AMETER : An Alsa meter plugin for Linux audio software , with a graphical display .
	
			http://laugeo.free.fr/ameter.html

	This program aims at giving level metering capability to Alsa audio programs 
that does not have it, and that cannot use Jack/Meterbrige  ( Glame is an example, 
as arecord/aplay or mplayer ).
	It can be used also for OSS applications (using alsa-oss, aoss
wrapper and a properly written .asoundrc). 

	It has an overload indicator, which can be resetted by pressing a key.

(This plugin is heavily based on the level meter plugin from  
Abramo Bagnara <abramo@alsa-project.org>
(originally with a ncurse display),
and on Meterbridge from Steve Harris ( http://plugin.org.uk/meterbridge/ ),
for the SDL display code.)

Thanks to Andrew Burgess (http://www.cichlid.com) for fixing the aplay problem when interrupting with ctrl+c.

1) Requirements :

	- Alsa ( tested with 1.0.9)
	- SDL and SDL_image with PNG support: packages should come with your Linux distribution 
	(tested with version 1.2 (may work with 1.0))

	
2) Compilation :

	./configure
	make
	su -c "make install"

3) Edit  (or create) .asoundrc file in your home directory to have the following lines :

pcm_scope.ameter {
	type ameter
}
pcm_scope_type.ameter {
	lib /usr/local/lib/libameter.so
}
pcm.ameter {
	type meter
	slave.pcm 'hw:0,0'
	frequency 50
	scopes.0 ameter
}
pcm.dsp0 ameter


( The frequency parameter is the nb of update/sec , 50 is the default value)

4) Test :
        

	Using Glame: 
	- In audio preferences:
		- Set output plugin to alsa_audio_out 
		- Set output device to ameter
	(This is ok for playing and recording)

	Using aplay/arecord:
	aplay -D ameter sound.wav 
	arecord -D ameter soundrec.wav
	

	Using mplayer:
	mplayer -ao alsa:device=ameter /tmp/film.avi 	

	Using alsa-oss:
        aoss realplay /usr/lib/RealPlayer8/firstrun.rm


5) Limitations :
	- Only one stereo sound card
